Julia Hancock in a 3rd year PhD student in the Rorrer lab. She created Chroma Quant to help analyze the products she was working with. She wants to know if Chroma Quant works well. She knows everything about it because she made it. 

Franklin is a 1st year PhD student in the Rorrer lab. He wants to use ChromaQuant to analyze products from the breakdown of oxygenated plastics. He needs the tool to quickly and accurately detect multiple carbon products. He is somewhat familiar with Python. 

Mariya is a 1st year PhD student. She wants to use ChromaQuant to analyze chromatographic data from gas and liquid hydrocarbon reaction products. She needs the tool to be adaptable for different types of hydrocarbon analysis, potentially integrating with protein design research. She is comfortable with Python but new to chromatography. 

Enisha is a 2nd year PhD student in the Baker Lab. She wants to use ChromaQuant to analyze the traces from an enzymatic reaction she is desiging. She wants to be able to have a easy to use, intuitive software to analyze spec traces to reach her desired outcome. She is familiar with bash language and python syntax. 

Tata is a 1st year PhD student in the Rorrer lab. He wants to use Chroma Quant to analyze products from his work with polystyrene and bibenzyl. He needs the tool to accurately account for aromatic groups. Tata is new to using gas chromatography, and is somewhat comfortable with python. 

Jason is a quality control analyst at a pharmaceutical company. He wants to verify the purity and composition of drug formulations by analyzing chromatograms efficiently. He needs the tool to be highly precise, with customizable peak detection thresholds to comply with regulatory standards. He also wants integration with existing lab data systems. He is proficient in GC-MS interpretation but has no coding experience.

Sophie is an R&D chemist at a materials science company. She wants to analyze polymer degradation products to improve material stability. She needs the tool to accurately differentiate overlapping peaks and deconvolute complex mixtures. She also wants it to handle large datasets efficiently. She is comfortable with GC-MS and has intermediate Python skills.

Alex is a data scientist working in a biotech startup. He wants to use the software to automate peak detection and compound identification from GC-MS data to assist chemists in analyzing experimental results. He needs the tool to provide clear, structured outputs with minimal manual intervention and the ability to integrate results into machine learning pipelines. He is highly proficient in Python and data analysis but unfamiliar with chromatographic techniques.

Jordan is a lab technician at a startup developing sustainable fuels. They want to use the software to process GC-MS data and generate reports for senior chemists without manually analyzing chromatograms. They need the tool to be fully automated, providing clear, easy-to-understand results with minimal input. Since they are unfamiliar with both GC-MS and programming, they also want an intuitive interface, step-by-step guidance, and simple export options for sharing results. They have general lab experience but no background in chromatography or coding.
